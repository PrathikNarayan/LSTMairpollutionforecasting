# LSTMairpollutionforecasting

This repo consists of the project I undertook for TARP Course during my BTech for credit requirements. <br>

As of today, the project is going through the publication procedure under IGI Global as book chapter. Once the book chapter releases I will add a link to the same as well for the write up regarding the project. <br>

Description: <br>
This study uses multivariate LSTM Time series forecasting techniques to understand and apply multiple variables together to contribute more accuracy to forecasting due to its proven track record of success with time-series data. The factors that were found to have a major effect on Air Quality are Dew point, wind speed,  temperature, snowfall and rain conditions. In particular, this model focuses on predicting and forecasting the concentrations of PM2.5(Atmospheric Particulate Matter with a diameter of less than 2.5mm) as it has been proven that this pollutant has a major effect on human health worldwide. <br> 

Files included:<br> 
LSTM-Multivariate_pollution.csv is the raw dataset used for this project. Pollution_test_data1.csv is the preprocessed dataset which is added to the repo for easy viewing. air_pollution_forecasting.....ipynb is the main python notebook, google colab link for the code is given as well.
